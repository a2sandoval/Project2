Animal Friendship,good,minor,1,"Some people just have a natural affinity for animals - creatures seem to like them for no apparent reaason. Maybe they just smell friendly or give of the right signals, but animals are put at ease and may even go against their training to greet their new friend","When encountering an animal for the first time, the character may attempt to show it that they mean no harm and calm any aggressive tendencies. This trait gives them a +2 modifier to a Presence and Convince skill roll to calm an animal. With a Fantastic result, the animal, even a trained guard dog, may adopt the character as their new master!",2,0,0,0
Arrogant,good,minor,1,"While it doesn't make them very easy to get along with, some individuals have a powerful confidence that allows them to deal with any situation.","The character gains +2 to resisting fear and feelings of hopelessness, but suffers -1 to social interactions with those they consider to be inferior.",2,-1,0,0
Attractive,good,minor,1,"For every horrible beastie the Doctor encounters, there's a pretty face. Of course, a lot of this is subjective, and can depend upon personal taste or even species! After all, Chantho was kinda pretty for a big bug lady, even to us humans, so imagine how pretty she would be to another of the Malmooth on Malcassairo. Having the Attractive trait means the character is attractive and pleasant on the eye.","The Attractive trait comes into play whenever the character is doing something that their looks can influence. As a Good Trait, the character will get a +2 bonus to any rolls that involve their stunning good looks, from charming their way past guards to getting information out of someone.",2,0,76,0
Biochemical Genius,good,major,2,Some peoplee are a dab hand with chemistry and biology and have a natural 'feel' for the way the two combine.,"The character gains Areas of Expertise for the Science skill in Biology and Chemistry and may create biological or chemical 'Gadgets' using the Jiggery-Pokery rules, using the Science skill instead of Technology for all relevant rolls.",0,0,0,0
Boffin,good,major,2,Boffin is a term that originated in WWII to describe those who constantly tinkered and experimented with equipment and technology to create futuristic devices. Having the Boffin trait means that you're a genius when it comes to tweaking with electronics and machinery to cobble together the most useful gadgets and gizmos.,"This trait allows the character to create Gadgets through the fine art of 'Jiggery-Pokery'. Your average Joe can try to open their household appliances and wire them together to make something -- though they'll probably only gain an electric shock or worse. Only a Boffin can create a useful device that can scan DNA, crack a safe, or disable Dalek forcefields. More details on creating Gadgets can be found on pg. 113.",0,0,73,0
Brave,good,minor,1,"Facing the invading monsters, bloodthirsty aliens, and the many threats that companions encouunter will mean that the characters are usually fairly courageous to even get involved. However, some people are more fearles, and can stare down a Sontaran in the face without flinching or shout at the Cybermen without worrying about the immieent reprisal.",The Brave trait provides a +2 bonus to any Resolve roll when the character could get scared or need to show courage,2,0,48,0
Charming,good,minor,1,"Robin Hood could probably charm his way through an entire adventure, just by smiling at the people he meets and carousing his way. Some people are naturally charming, and can make people swoon; very handy if you need to get people to do something for you, or to let you into a facility. The Charming trait reflects this additional seductive quality, and gives them an edge when trying to schmooze their way through any situation.","Charming is a Minor Good Trait, and when the character is trying to charm their way through an encounter, they recieve a +2 bonus to the roll. Useful for talking your way out of being killed, but not always suitable for every social situation.",2,0,0,0
Empathetic,good,minor,1,"People naturally hide their true emotinos unless they are really upset or stressed, and it takes training or a natural gidt to be able to read the tiny signals that give away what they're really thinking or feeling. Some people have an empathy with how others arre feeling and can use this gift to aid them when trying to get information or to calm someone down.","Empathetic is a Minor Good Trait that provides the character with a +2 bonus on any rolls when they are trying to empathise or read another person. This could be a simple Presence + Convince roll to reassure someone who's panicking in the middle of a battle, or an Awareness + Ingenuity roll to try to read another's actions and speech to see if they're lying.",2,0,0,0
Face in the Crowd,good,minor,1,"Some people can be unremarkable in manner or appearance, or are so comfortable in foreign places and with alien creatures that they can fade into the background and not be too noticeable. This means that despite wearing something that might not be authentic to the time period, you fiit in and people seem to ignore your 'alien-ness'.","As long as they're not dressing like a clown or anything too weird, and not doing anything that'll attract their attention, people will leave the character to go about what they're doing. If the Gamemaster asks for a roll to 'blend in', the trait provides a bonus of +2 to any Subterfuge skill roll when they're trying to sneak about and not get noticed when in a crowd of people.",2,0,53,0
Fast Healing (Major),good,major,2,"The ability to recover quickly from an injury is bound to be usefull in your daily attempts to fend off alien invasion. Some people simple recoer quicker than others, halting the bleeding and managing to carry on.","As a Major Good Trait, the character will heal any damage they have sustained quicker than a normal person. Any Attribute Points they have lost due to injury are regainst at a rate of 1 point per hour, though the Gamemaster may decide that broken bones will take longer to heal. They might not be able to regrow lost limbs or comete in athletic events with a gunshot wound, but they'll still be up on their feet faster than most. The player may still have to rationalize why the character can heal quickly with the Gamemaster before taking this trait.",0,0,0,0
Friends (Minor),good,minor,1,"The character has people they can call upon for information or help. They may have reliable friends who can help them out (maybe they know someone who has some political pull or is well respected in the community), contacts within an institution (do they know someone who works in UNIT, Torchwood, or even the White House?), or someone who can supply information (a shady guy who keeps finding out things that the public aren't meant to know). Friends can be either a Minor or a Major Trait, depending upon how informative or helpful the friend in question is!","As a minor trait, they know someone who knows someone -- a 'friend of a friend', but the source (and their information) is usually reliable. It may be that they know a friend who works at the local newspaper or council office who hears things as they're reported and can steer the character in the direction of strange events. Their contact may be putting themselves at risk to get the information to the character, but it's unlikely to be discovered. It should be noted that away from their home planet, unless their Friends are time and space travellers, this trait cannot be used where the friends cannot help them.",0,0,0,0

Friends can be either a Minor a Major Trait, depending upon how informative or helpful the friend in question is!","As a Major Trait, the person in the know is far more reliable, the information is accurate, or their contact may be leaking information fro somewhere like UNIT or maybe even be someone of power like Winston Churchill or the Queen of England! Their contact may be putting themselves at risk to get the information to the character, but it's unlikely to be discovered. It should be noted that away from their home planet, unless their Friends are time and space travellers, this trait cannot be used where the friends cannot help them.",0,0,0,0
Hot Shot,good,minor,1,Some people are a natural when it comes to most forms of transport. They can fly planes through the harshest of tunderstorms or drive cars at high speeds without crashing. They are the best of the best when it comes to piloting vehicles.,"Hot Shot is a Minor Good Trait providing the character with a +2 bonus to all Transport rolls. This bonus is especially effective when used to push the speed of a vehicle, as they can get the best performance from the craft.",2,0,0,0
Hypnosis (Minor),good,minor,1,"The Doctor has been known to use a bit of hypnotism to calm a savage beast and to help people to remember things, putting them in a calm and relaxed state. Hypnosis as a Minor Good Trait means that the character can put people into a mild hypnotic state. We're not talking mind control here, just some basic hypnotic techniques -- a tone of voice, a calm way of talking -- that can calm people down and possibly influence them to do what you want.","As a Minor Trait, Hypnosis adds a +2 bonus to any social interaction where you're trying to either calm someone down or get them to do what you'd like. It's dependent upon the situation of course; the Gamemaster may not allow in the middle of a battlefield, for instance. Usually, there should be few distractions, and the target and the hypnotist should be able to hear and see each other, unless there is some advanced or alien technology involved. The target can resist using Ingenuity + Resolve.",2,0,0,0
Hypnosis (Major),good,major,2,"The Doctor has been known to use a bit of hypnotism to calm a savage beast and to help people to remember things, putting them in a calm and relaxed state. The Major Good trait verges on mind control, and not the sort of thing a companion would do.","The Major Trait works much is the same way as the Minor Trait (+2 bonus to the interaction, few distractions, must be able to see/hear the target), but if the character succeeds in hypnotising the subject (using Presence + Convince), they can make them do anything not intrinsically against their nature (such as harm a friend or themselves) -- in this case, the target can make another roll to resist (with a +3 bonus to an Ingenuity + Resolve roll) to snap out of their hypnotic state, waking to wonder what they were doing. No matter what, they cannot be nypnotised into killing themselves -- their survival instinct is too strong.",2,0,0,0
Indomitable,good,major,2,"That's the human race all round... indomitable. The character has determination and an iron will, meaning they are better at resisting mind control and hypnosis. They have something that grounds them, reassures them of who they are and protect their minds against invasion or hypnotic control.","The Indomitable tait gives the character s +4 bonus to any rolls to resits becoming possessed, hypnotised, psychically controlled, or similar. In many ways, this trait can also be used to avoid being dissuaded from their course of action -- for example, River Song is usually determined to go off by herself despite the Doctor's warnings. If the Doctor tried to convince her to stay, her Indomitable nature would help her to remin single-minded and determined to do as she wants, even if it isn't the best idea in the world.",4,0,0,0
Keen Senses (Minor),good,minor,1,"The character is very aware of their surroundings. Whether they have a keen eye for detail and noticing when something is wrong, or a nose for a particular scent, they are particularly perceptive -- always a good thing when tracking or encountering alien intruders.","As a Minor Trait, you should specify which of the character's senses is particularly keen. A +2 bonus only applies to Awareness rolls that use that sense, whether it is sight, hearing, smell, touch, tase, or that elusive sixth sense. Only one sense can be chosen -- more than one and it's a Major Trait.",2,0,0,0

Lucky,good,minor,1,"Lady Luck is on their side. Call it a fluke, call it chance, but fortune is smsiling on the character. The traffic lights changed just at the right moment to give them a chance to get through, they just managed to roll under the blast doors before they closed and they flicked the right switch to restart the ship's engines. Every day is their lucky day!","The character is lucky! Simple as that. If you roll snake-eyes (two '1's on your dice), you're probably going to fail. At least normally. Characters with the Lucky trait get a second chance when snake-eyes are rolled. You can re-roll both dice, trying for something better. If you get snake-eyes again, well, your luck obviously doesn't run that far, and you must keep the second result.",0,0,0,0
Military Rank (Minor),good,minor,1,"The character has a military rank, with all the privileges and responsibilities that entails.

If they belong to UNIT but do not have this trait they are considered to be regular enlisted soldiers (Privates or Corporals).","As a Major Trait, the character is a Lieutennant.

Noble,good,minor,1,"Some people are born into the highest levels of society and are used to entertaining dignitaries, ambassadors, and even kings and queens.","The character's experience gives them a _2 bonus whenever they deal socially with the cream of society, especially when you are in a formal environment",2,0,0,0
Owed Favor (Minor),good,minor,1,"Someone out there owes the character a favor. It can be anything from a sum of money, repayment for introducing them to their future spouse, or even saving their life. Whatever it was, they're not going to forget it, and in the character's moment of need they can be called upong to help out in a dire situation.","As a Minor Trait, the favor is something relatively small -- a small amount of money (only $1000 or so), introducint someone to them who later became a valuable business client or romantic partner, or you bailed them out when they were in trouble. If appropriate, you may opt to call in the favor and seek assistance in the current adventure. Of course, if you ask for a favor bigger than the original debt, they may walk off after saying 'we're quits, don't call on me again', or you could even end up owing them a favorr, and gain the Owes Favor Bad Trait",0,0,0,0

Percussive Maintenance,good,minor,1,"There are some people (mad scientists, leather jacketed greasers from the 1950s, etc.) who have a rather peculiat innate understanding of machines that allows them to activate malfunctioning machinery with a single well placed blow to the appropriate area.","Whenever the character fails to roll to repaire some sort of technology, they may immediately whack it with their fist or some other object and may roll again, replacing Ingenuity with Strength. They may only attempt this once per repair. In addition, if they don't have time to make a proper repair, they may use Percussive Maintenance to get a piece of technology temporarily working by making a Strength + Technology roll. On a Success the tech will work for one use, on a Good Success it will work for 1d6 uses, and on a Fantastic Success it will continue to function until the Gamemaster decides otherwisee.",0,0,0,0
Photographic Memory,good,major,2,"With just a few seconds of concentration, the character can commit something to memory to be instantly recalled when needed. People with this trait rarely have problems passing exams, and can remember exact lines from books.","The Photographic Memory trait can be used in a couple different ways. If the character knows they're going to have to remember something at a later time, such as the combination to a lock or the instruction to program a computer, they can spend a moment to take the information in and commit it to memory. If they want to recal the information, they can without having to roll, but they must have declared that they've taken the time to concentrate and remember it as the time. Similarly, if they want to remember something that they haven't actively committed to memory, there's a chance it may be stored in there somewhere long with last week's shopping list of what time that film is on that they wanted to watch. To revall something vital that they may have only glanced at or possibly missed altogether, you can spend a Story Point.",0,0,56,0
Psychic Training,good,minor,1,"Don't you just hate it when you wave your Psychic Paper at someone and they don't see anything? Psychic Training means they are able to protect themselves from mental coercion or deception and are aware of psychic attack or memory alteration. They can put up basic defenses to protect themselves, which can be as simple as imagining a plain white wall to repeating a Beatles tune in their head.","This Minor Trait gives the character s +2 bonus to Resolve rolls when trying to resist psychic attack or deception. It doesn't always work, but it is strong enough to resist a low level telepathic field such as that of Psychic Paper.",0,0,0,0
Quick Reflexes,good,minor,1,"The character is fast to act when things happen, reacting to situations almost instinctively. It doesn't mean they cannot be surprised -- if they don't know something's coming they can't react to it -- but when something attacks or bad happens, they're often the first to react to it.","In a conflict situation, when they haven't been taken completely by surprise, the character is assumed to always go first when acting at the same time as others. They won't always fo first in a round, but if two or more people are acting in a single phase (such as Talkers, Runners, etc.), the person with Quick Reflexes goes first. If more than one person in a phase has the Quick Reflexes trait, the character with the higher relative attribute goes first.",0,0,71,72
Resourceful Pockets,good,minor,1,"The Doctor has said that he has pockes like the TARDIS, and he does seem to carry some strange things around in them. Sometimes people just have that knack of accumulating things -- nothing terirbly important or bulky, but little things that can be useful when you have to MacGyver something together at a time of peril. If you have the Resourceful Pockets trait there's a chance, albeit a slim one, that you may have something useful in them that could get you out of a sticky situation. Remember, Resourceful Pockets doesn't have to mean 'pockets' -- you could have an excellent utility belt, and who knows what can be found in a handbag.","The player can either spend a Story Point and find the ting they need, or roll 2d6. If they get a double (i.e. two 3s or snake-eyes), then they find something helpful in their pocket, from a cricket ball to a clockwork mouse. Of course it may not be exactly what you were expecting, butt it may still be useful in someway.",0,0,0,0
Reverse the Polarity of the Neutron Flow,good,major,2,Those with a particular genius for science have an innate understanding of the ebb and flow of energy and can make intuitive leaps that allow them to solve scintific and technological problems through unusual applications of that energy.,"This trait may be used once per adventure.

Run for your Life!,good,minor,1,"There are many times when the opposing forces are too numerous or just too powerful to take down. The best thing you can do is to flee, run for your life and regroup to plan a new angle of attack. The character with this trait has obviously got this running thing down to a fine art and when danger is close behind there is that extra motivation to simple scarper!","The character is better at running away from danger, usually due to all the practice they've had! When being chased, you receive a +1 bonus to your Speed when fleeing.",1,0,0,0
Screamer!,good,minor,1,"The character has been known to scream in the face of terro on many occasion, and this ear-splitting sound will penetrate miles of corridor to alert others to their location and the imminent threat.","At times when they are scared or threatened, the character can scream their lungs out. No roll is necessary, though using this trait will cost a Story Point. Anything or anyone else in the room will be stunned and will be unable to act for their next action. The Screamer should take their next action running away while the enemy is stunned -- they are rareely brave enough to do anything else. The scream also alerts their companions, and the rest of the group will automatically know the direction they are in.",0,0,6,0
Sense of Direction,good,minor,1,"There are some people who instinctively know the easiest way to get from one place to the next. it may be a labyrinthine maze of streets and identical houses, but characters with the Sense of Direction trait rarely seem to get lost, or can usually find their bearings if they do.","This trait gives the character a +2 bonus to any roll (usually Awareness and Ingenuity) to regain their direction when lost, or to simply work out how to get from A to B. This can be map reading, running through miles of similar corridors, or simply knowing which way is up while spinning in zero gravity.",2,0,0,0
Technically Adept,good,minor,1,"The character has an innate connection to technology, and can sometimes fix things just by hitting them! They're skilled enough to operate and repair most things with limited tool, taking half the time it normally takes. Often, if the device stopped working within thirty minutes, it can restarted just by thumping it. It may not last long, but long enough....","The Technically Adept trait provides the character with +2 to any Technology roll to fix a broken or faulty device, and to use complex gadgets or equipment. The bonus also applies to any gadget-creating jiggery-pokery, and can be combined with the Boffin trait.",2,0,73,0
Time Traveller (Minor),good,minor,1,"The character is experienced with the technology and society of time periods different to their own. The Time Traveller trait also reflects how much travelling in time the character has done, and can be used as a rough indicator of how much background Artron Radiation they have picked up from travelling the Vortex. While this isn't actually harmful, some alien races have been knwn to target individuals that have high Artron levels to fuel or activate their technology.","Players define the character's home Technology Level, and using the technology from outside of the character's experience may impose penalties as they're unfamiliar with the way it works. The Time Traveller trait means that they're used to some time periods and can operate the technology with little or no penalty. The character automatically has a familiarity with their home Tech Level, but the Time Traveller trait records additional Tech Levels they're comfortable with. Lower Technology Levels to their home are Minor Good Traits, whereas more advanced Technology Levels are Major Good Traits. Technology Levels do not come into play all of the time -- after all a gun is a gun and a socket wrench is a socket wrench, but there are times when technology is so advanced or primitive that your character may feel out of place or unable to recognise the technology for what it is.

Tough,good,minor,1,"Not everyone can take a punch on the nose and brush it off as if nothing had happened. Few people can take getting shot or starved, tortured or wounded in the course of their everyday lives.

Voice of Authority,good,minor,1,"The character has the air of command about them, possibly from being a figure of authority -- a doctor, politician, military commander or a police constable -- or they may have an aura of intelligence or experience that inspires people to listen and trust their judgement.

Amnesia (Minor),bad,minor,-1,"Memory is a fragile thing that can easily be manipulated or lsot entirely.

This could be deliberate, the result of mind-wiping technology, psychic powers, or Torchwood's amnesia drug Retcon, or due to mental or physical damage.","As a Minor Bad Trait, the character has lost a portion of their memory. It could be as small as a couple days, weeks, or even a couple years, but the character will have no idea of what happened to them in that time.

Events, sights, sounds, or even smells can trigger memories of their lost time, and this is a great source of adventure ideas for the Gamemaster -- over many adventures the character can uncover more and more of their 'lost time'.

Argumentative,bad,minor,-1,"Some people just think they're right all the time, even when they're not. Some even provoke an argument just for arguing's sake. Characters with the Argumentative trait are like this and will argue their point of view even if it is with their teammates or with the leader of an invading alien fleet. However, they don't start arguments all the time -- that would make the character impossible to be around, but when someone contradicts their opinion or knowledge, they will actively try to correct them.","This is a Minor Trait, so it shouldn't get in the way too much of their normal behaviour.

By the Book,bad,minor,-1,"I'm sorry, I can't let you do that. Protocol clearly states that you must follow the correct procedure when you are opening a dialogue with a potentially hostile species. I really shouldn't let you do that at all. Look, if you want to go that way and ignore the signs, then be my guest. I, however, will be following the arrows to the nearest escape hatch while putting on my life jacket.","The character will follow instructions, advice, or correct procedure to the letter without deviating. Soldiers with intensive military training often have this trait, following the orders of the commanding officer without question. It doesn't mean the character is a mindless drone, but it does mean that it may take some serious convincing to get them to go against their training or orders. If someone tries to convince them otherwise, they will usually make an Ingenuity and Rsolve roll, and the trait gives them a +2 bonus on the roll. This is a bonus, despite it being a Bad Trait, as most of the time failing to show initiative and going against orders will result in putting themselves in danger or annoying their treammates. The bonus does however, also apply when trying to resist Hypnosis or Possession if the mental control is trying to get them to do something they'd normally refuse to do.",2,0,0,0

Cowardly,bad,minor,-1,"Facing those monsters, some people become nervous wrecks rather than becoming hardened to it.

If people discovered the secret the character could be arrested and imprisoned again, or shot at by law enforcement agents. Your companions may be sympathetic, knowing you've changed your ways, but it doesn't stop the Judoon or the local police from hunting you once you've been discovered.
